### The Docker usage is simply based on docker-compose:

*To build the container*

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up --build
```

*To login to the container*

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml exec /bin/bash
```

It should be ready now.

> Note: if you updated/edited the code just run the build command again to get the new changes.
